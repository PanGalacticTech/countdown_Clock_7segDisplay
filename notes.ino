 *     digit    <---- Object

      made up of 7 segments {

                  A
                  B
                  C
                  D
                  E 
                  F
                  G

                }


each of those segments made up of 3 LEDs each, which need to be the same colour.


A = 0, 1, 2

B = 3, 4, 5 

...etc.




each segment object has methods

    .on
    .off
    .setColour
    .setBrighness

but each of these functions could also be applied to the parent class to change the colour of all the segments at the same time.






then I can set up a 2nd instance of this object to make the 2nd digit....etc for however many digets I require
